--- ABOUT FRED ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRED expands upon the raw 1kB block file concept by using standard FAT32 files & breaking them up into 4K pages preformatted as
32 CR terminated lines of 127 characters. Pages allow a fixed sized chunk to be edited and saved thus using minimal resources. 
  Insertions and deletions are on a character per line or a line per page basis and changes can be saved manually with ^S.     
  Up to 32 Lines to be copied or cut to a clipboard and pasted.                                                                
A block of text can be selected with ^B to mark the beginning and then ^C or ^X to copy or cut that block.                     
  The preformatted FAT32 file also means that these files can be read as regular text files on other devices and copied etc.   
By using standard ANSI terminal controls the navigations keys work intuitively and special control key sequences are kept to   
a minimum and for less common functions only.                                                                                  
--- COMPATIBILITY ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  An IMPORT feature allows standard text files to be imported as fixed width page files and is used by the SAVEAS function &S  
to import from the current file tab into fixed page format in a new file tab. If though the output file exists then it will be 
overwritten. When a file is initially opened it is edit protected in VIEW mode only but ^E places it into EDIT mode which is   
remembered by the automatic session save. So pages are like blocks but the many pages make up a FAT32 file plus each line is   
CR terminated for compatibility.
